# Hello World with j'bang

In this small course you'll create a hello world app with jbang.

To begin we need `jbang` installed. In this environment the simplest are to use sdkman.

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install jbang
```{{execute}}

jbang is available to install from multiple various package managers and manual zip download. You can read more at this [readme](https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang).
